### Introduction

A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, the Millenium Falcon is fighting Imperial TIE-Fighters. The Millenium Falcon can move in right, left, up and down directions using the arrow keys and shoot rockets by pressing the spacebar. When the game begins, a group of TIE-Fighters will fill the sky. The user shoots and destroys the TIE-Fighters. If the user shoots all the TIE-Fighters, a new fleet will appear, that moves faster than the last one. If any TIE-Fighter hits the player ship or reaches the bottom, the user will lose a life. If the user loses three lifes, the game will be over.
