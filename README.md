# Alien-Invasion-Game
The user controls a spaceship. He can move the ship in right and left direction using the arrow keys and shoot rockets by pressing the spacebar. When the game begins, a group of aliens will fill the sky. The user shoots and destroys the aliens. If the user shoots all the aliens, a new fleet will appear, that moves faster than the last one. If any alien hits the player ship or reaches the bottom, the user will lose a ship. If the user loses three ships, the game will be over.
